# A Simple Text Parser

A simple website where you can see how many vowels and consonants there are in a piece of text.

You can test it here: [Website Preview](https://text-parser-plum.vercel.app/).

## Goal

Create a web page with a `textarea` box in which a user can write whatever they want.

Then parse the text and show some information about it, like:

- [x] How many consonants does the text have?
- [x] And how many vowels?

## What I learned

I learned how to use JavaScript to interact with elements in the DOM using `event listeners`.

I'm sure this will be very useful going forward!
